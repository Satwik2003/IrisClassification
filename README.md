# Oasis Infobyte Task 1
 
This repository is to show my work for task 1 of the Data Science internship at Oasis Infobyte.

## Task 1 - Iris Classification

Task 1 was to develop a classification model that can classify the iris plant into its different species based on features of its sepals and petals.

## Approach

For the task, I used sci-kit's K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm as it proves to work proficiently on a non-linear and small dataset. 

## Performance

The model is 98.8% and 95% accurate on training and testing sets on a 40-60 split.
